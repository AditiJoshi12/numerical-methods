# numerical-methods
A numerical method is an approximate computer method for solving a mathematical problem which often has no analytical solution. This repository contains several algorithms for solving Systems of Linear Equations, tracing trajectories when given derivative or double-derivative, finding maximum and minimum eigenvalues, Integration and Random Numbers.
