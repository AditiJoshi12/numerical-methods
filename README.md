# Numerical Methods

A numerical method is an approximate computer method for solving a mathematical problem which often has no analytical solution. This repository contains several algorithms for solving systems of linear and non-linear equations, tracing trajectories when given derivative or double-derivative, finding maximum and minimum eigenvalues, numerical integration(such as Newton-Cotes and Gauss Quadrature), random number generators, finite difference methods for solving ODEs and PDEs(particularly parabolic equations).
